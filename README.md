# Clustering-Driver_data.csv
Used Clustering algorithms to find the optimal number of clusters for segmenting the drivers based on mean distance driven per day 
For each driver we have two features: mean distance driven per day and the mean percentage of time a driver was >5 mph over the speed limit.

Ran the K-Means algorithm on this dataset and found the optimal number of clusters and gathered insights from these clusters
Performed Agglomerative clustering on the same dataset with an appropriate number of clusters. Plotted the dendrogram.
Compared the results from  K-Means model and  Agglomerative clustering model using silhouette scores to find Which model is superior
